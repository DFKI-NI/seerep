## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Robotic sensor data management integrated with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).
- Creation of sub-datasets based on sub-symbolic information (positions,
timestamps) and their corresponding symbolic (semantic) information.
- Automated generation and evaluation (e.g neural network predictions) of
datasets.
- GDPR filtering of datasets (e.g excluding public roads) based on spatial
polygon queries.

## :muscle: Motivation

A key transition in robotics involves the adoption of data-driven approaches.
As a result, increasing amounts of data are being captured by high-resolution
sensors such as cameras and LiDAR.
With ROS, the typical workflow involves recording rosbags during missions and
uploading the resulting files to network or blob storage, organized according to
use-case specific hierarchies.
Later retrieval of data with specific properties, such as particular weather
conditions or a specific area of interest, is non-trivial. The relevant data
must be downloaded to open the rosbag where access to the data is only provided
through the time modality.

In contrast, SEEREP offers an integrated solution for managing robotic sensor
data and generating sub-datasets based on spatial, temporal, or semantic
queries. Simplifying the workflow to uploading the sensor data post-mission and
offering a gRPC-based query interface for subsequent applications.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The simplest way to start SEEREP is by using `docker compose` with the
configuration provided in the `docker/server` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agri-gaia/seerep.git
cd seerep/docker/server
docker compose up
```

Which should produce an output like this:

```bash
seerep_server | [2024-07-11 13:40:00.853800]<info>: Initialized logging
seerep_server | [2024-07-11 13:40:00.860308]<info>: The used logging folder is: /mnt/seerep_data/log/
seerep_server | [2024-07-11 13:40:00.860730]<info>: Current timezone: CET
seerep_server | [2024-07-11 13:40:00.861233]<info>: SEEREP version: N/A

seerep_server | [2024-07-11 13:40:00.867241]<info>: Added Flatbuffers gRPC services
seerep_server | [2024-07-11 13:40:00.903333]<info>: Serving gRPC Server on "[::]:9090"
```

For other ways to deploy SEEREP, check the
[documentation](https://agri-gaia.github.io/seerep/mkdocs/getting-started/server_deployment/).

Refer to the [examples section](https://github.com/agri-gaia/seerep/tree/update-readme/examples/python/gRPC)
for instructions on uploading data.
