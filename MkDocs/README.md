# Using MkDocs loaclly

Since the documentation is currently not published to GitHub Pages, it needs to
be run locally. For that, switch into the MkDocs folder (where the `mkdocs.yaml`
is located) and use `mkdocs serve` to start the server. The page should then be
available under [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
